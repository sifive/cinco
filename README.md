# README #

This repository allows you to program Freedom E300 boards using the Arduino IDE. Follow the instructions below to install the Board support package manually.

# Setup #

## Install Arduino ##

Download and install Arduino IDE 1.6.12 tarball from the Arduino website. Unpack it and run their installation script as directed.

## Install this Repo ###
* clone this repo wherever you like, and then create a symlink:
```
git clone --recursive http://github.com/sifive/cinco.git
cd /opt/arduino-1.6.12/hardware/
ln -s path-to-this-repo/hardware sifive
```

## Install RISC-V Tools and OpenOCD ##

```
cd path-to-this-repo
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd hardware/freedom_e/freedom-e-sdk
make tools
```

Add the toolchain to your path:

```
export PATH=$CINCO/hardware/freedom_e/freedom-e-sdk/toolchain/bin:$PATH
```

You may need to edit your udev rules in order to connect.

```
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules/99-openocd.rules
TODO: Write the lines here that you need
```

Then your device should show up under `/dev/ttyUSB0` and `/dev/ttyUSB1`. You 
will use the first interface to debug and program your board. You will use the 
second interface to connect to the UART using `screen` or `minicom` or the
Arduino Serial Console.

Make sure you have permissons to communicate with your USB
devices. Generally this means adding yourself to the 'dialout' or
'plugdev' group(s). After plugging in the board you want to talk to, try the 
commands below:

```
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*

crw-rw-r-- 1 root plugdev 188, 1 Nov 28 12:53 /dev/ttyUSB1
```

In the above example, I'd need to add myself to the 'plugdev' group.

```
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev <your_user_name>
```

You probably have to log out and log back in, then check that you're now a member of the plugdev group:

```
groups
... plugdev ... 
```

## Connecting to the HiFive1 Board

* Make sure a jumper is installed for IOREF, to either 3.3V or 5V, depending
on the shield or other devices you want to communicate with.

* Plug in a USB micro cable to the micro USB connector on the HiFive1
board.

* The device will show up as `Future Devices Dual RS232-HS` . Determine which
serial port to use, e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0-3`, by running the `lsusb` command
and seeing which Bus the device shows up on. This will be useful if you want to 
see Serial output from your device.

```
screen /dev/ttyUSB1 <baud rate>
```

* You can optionally use an external 7-12V DC Power supply. The
power supply will switch from USB automatically.

## Connecting to the Freedom E300 Arty Dev Kit (with Olimex Debugger)

* Connect one USB cables to the micro USB connector on the Arty board,
and one USB cable to the Olimex. Follow the instructions at

https://dev.sifive.com/develop/freedom-e300-arty-dev-kit

to connect your Arty board to the Olimex debugger.

* Determine where the devices show up as `/dev/ttyUSB0-3`.
The ordering of these is nondeterministic based on when order that things
get plugged in/etc but that only matters when you want to use serial console.  

```
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB1 (or sometimes ttyUSB3)
```

## Select Your Programmer ##

Select the board (e.g. Freedom E300 Arty Dev Kit) on the Arduino Menu

Tools->Board->Freedom E 300 Dev Kit

Tools->Programmer->openocd

## Write & Upload Your Program ##

Select an example program and modify it as usual.

For example, use the 'Blink' example, which needs
no modifications.

Hit the "Verify" button to test the program compiles,
then "Upload" to program to the board.
